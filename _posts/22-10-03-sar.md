# sar writeup

### this gonna be a small writeup for only the important steps

we found that there is a hidden file
![](/blog/sar/hiddenfile.png)

this file shows us some informations that could help us
lets google the service name and version
![](/blog/sar/revshell.png)

we found a repo that could help us to revershell in github
after taking the revershell now m going to use a revshell repo
and upload an important file
![](/blog/sar/gettherevfilephp.png)
now we've been uploaded the rev.php and edited the write.sh
and make it run the rev.php to get the revershell
we did that because the finally.sh runs the write.sh and
the sudo runs the finally.sh 
![](/blog/sar/done.png)
after that we are in as a root so we got ourflag there

# sorry for this very short writeup
